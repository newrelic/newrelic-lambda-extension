# newrelic-lambda-extension [![Build Status][1]][2]

An AWS Lambda Extension to collect, enhance and transport telemetry to New Relic
for your AWS Lambda functions with hout
requiring an external transport such as CloudWatch Logs or Kinesis.

This lightweight AWS Lambda Extension runs alongside your AWS Lambda functions
and automatically handles the collection and transport of telemetry from
supported New Relic serverless agents.


## Installation

To install the extension, simply include the layer with your instrumented
Lambda function. The current layer ARN can be found [here][3].

[3]: https://layers.newrelic-external.com

**Note:** This extension is included with all New Relic AWS Lambda layers going forward.

You'll also need to make the New Relic license key available to the extension. Use the [New Relic Lambda CLI][4]
to install the managed secret, and then add the permission for the secret to your Lambda execution role.

>[Need example newrelic-lambda commands and example aws cli command to add perms]

After deploying your AWS Lambda function with one of the layer ARNs from the
link above you should begin seeing telemetry data in New Relic.

See below for details on supported New Relic agents.

## Building

Use the included `Makefile` to compile the extension. 

    make dist
    
will create the extension binary in `./extensions/newrelic-lambda-extension`

## Testing

To test locally, acquire the AWS extension test harness first. Then:

TODO: Link to the AWS SDK that has the test harness

1. (Optional) Use the `newrelic-lambda` CLI to create the license key managed secret in your AWS account and region.
2. Build the docker container for sample function code. Give it the tag `lambda_ext`.
   - Be sure to include your lambda function in the container.
3. Start up your container.

   - Using AWS Secret Manager
   
            export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id --profile default)
            export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key --profile default)
            export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(aws configure get aws_session_token --profile default)
    
            docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/extensions:/opt/extensions -p 9001:8080 \
                -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY -e AWS_SESSION_TOKEN \
                lambda_ext:latest \
                -h function.handler -c '{}' -t 60000

   - Or, setting the license key directly
   
            docker run --rm \
                -v $(pwd)/extensions:/opt/extensions \
                -p 9001:8080 \
                lambda_ext:latest \
                -h function.handler -c '{"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY": "your-license-key-here"}' -t 60000

4. To invoke the sample lambda run: 
   
       curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9001/2015-03-31/functions/function.handler/invocations' \
           -d 'invoke-payload'

5. Finally, you can exercise the container shutdown lifecycle event with:

        curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9001/test/shutdown' \
            -d '{"timeoutMs": 5000 }'

## Support

New Relic hosts and moderates an online forum where customers can interact with New Relic employees as well as other customers to get help and share best practices. Like all official New Relic open source projects, there's a related Community topic in the New Relic Explorers Hub. You can find this project's topic/threads here:
